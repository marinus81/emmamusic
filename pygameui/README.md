# pygameui

A simple GUI framework for [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org).

## Installation

    pip install pygameui

While Pygame is listed as a dependency in our package metadata, you should
[install it separately](http://www.pygame.org/install.html) ahead of time to
avoid issues with libpng being improperly referenced, etc.

## Environment

Tested on Mac OS X 10.7.3 running system Python 2.7.1 and Pygame installed via
the "Lion apple supplied python" mpkg.  Please let me know if you have issues
running this on other versions of Python and/or Pygame.
